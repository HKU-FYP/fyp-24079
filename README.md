### Project Description 

In todayâ€™s fast-paced financial markets, which operates in real-time and is highly sensitive to news and sentiments, tracking news in real-time is crucial. Investor often find it challenging to determine the relevance of news to their own portfolios and to track such information efficiently, even in real-time.
To address this issue, we propose developing an LLM-based real-time personalized financial news alert application.

This application aims to offers a website which allows users to input their investment portfolio and receive real-time notifications about relevant news with a summary of the news and an impact to the user portfolio. This ensures that users receive only the most relevant updates, enabling them to focus on news that matters for their financial decisions. Also, the content summary will help users quickly grasp key insights and suggest them which articles worth reading in full. 

By providing timely and relevant updates, this project will help individual investors make informed and quick decisions, empowering them to stay ahead in the financial markets with ease.
